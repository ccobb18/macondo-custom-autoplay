### Experiments between different level bots

These were run with the macondo shell `autoplay` command and the CSW19 lexicon.

These were run prior to renaming the CEL_BOTs to COMMON_WORD_BOTs.

e.g. `autoplay -lexicon CSW19 -botcode1 LEVEL4_PROBABILISTIC -botcode2 LEVEL3_CEL_BOT`

The numbers in parentheses after the Bot descriptions are the `BotFindabilities` and `BotParallelFindabilities` values for this experiment, respectively. See `/ai/runner/filters.go` for more information.

For the purposes of a good stratification then:

cel2 beats cel1 87.5%
cel3 beats cel2 81.2%
prob4 beats cel3 83.2% (the 0.6, 0.7 version)
hasty beats prob4 73.83%

The hasty win % vs prob4 is not as high as the others, but this is ok. It means this bot (prob4) will be pretty good, almost as good as Hasty.

### Non-English languages

For non-English languages, need to likely use the Level 1 through Level 3 probabilistic bots as well, since there is no CEL equivalent yet.

English baseline (CSW19):

```
Level 1 probabilistic (0.1, 0.1) vs HastyBot

Games played: 26372
exhaustiveleave-1 wins: 58.0 (0.220%)
exhaustiveleave-1 went first: 13267.0 (50.307%)
Player who went first wins: 13131.0 (49.791%)
exhaustiveleave-1 Mean Score: 254.913241  Stdev: 47.337143
exhaustiveleave-2 Mean Score: 528.591688  Stdev: 63.164315
exhaustiveleave-1 Mean Bingos: 0.751213  Stdev: 0.726710
exhaustiveleave-2 Mean Bingos: 2.509214  Stdev: 1.098549

```

L1 bot bingoes more often than the CEL-1, but its average score is still pretty low. This is probably a good level. It's not advisable to go too much lower than 0.1 for the findability factors because it'll make the bot slower.

Let's try it with the French lexicon.
